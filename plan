- add player 1
- jump, 1 square big, use just 2 square tall, 1 square wide
- add player 1 object to map
- get movement in place, jump - 3.25 square high
- have objects you can jump up through as well
- add platform object
- add moveable blocks
- add trampoline
- add moveable trampoline
- add switch to trigger moving platform
- add moving solid blocks, like door - vertical and horizontal
- add switch to trigger those too
- add power idea
- start with carrying it
- add throw it
- add only can move when in radius of power
- add power radius around it when throw it
- add player 2
- 1 square tall, can only jump 1.25 squares high
- get the idea of only moving when near power, throwing to each other, and picking up
- should be able to throw it, and drop it, and pick it up
- try for throw press button and throws in arc direction you facing
  - up, left, or right
- how long you hold button is how far, before releasing it
- so quick tap for drop
- up to 2 seconds for far throw - most you can throw is 16 squares
  - in 4 0.5 second intervals - try that to start,
  - otherwise maybe 8 - 0.25 intervals
- add exit to next level, and level changing
- next design a real level
- later add some different enemies


setting idea


two horrible cyborg lab experiments - lab being shut down
- ones like a head on a spider (short) - quicker, smaller jumps
- ones like a torso on piston legs - big jumper - but slower moving
- must save themselves
- run on power
- lots of other weird experiments in labs trying to stop them
- they are the only ones to achieve/or fully sentient
- no collectibles, just escape
- lab level 5 (below) - bio-tech - very dark, lab setting, certain types of cyborg experiments
- lab level 4 (below) - nano-tech - swarms, shapeshifting enemies, dissapearing matter
- lab level 3 (below) - marine experiments - underwater
- lab level 2 (below) - weapons - lots of lasers, beam weapons, and automated weapons
- lab level 1        - gravity experiments - floating/flying, opposite gravity

- with lasers have blocks that reflect and bend lasers and can move
- maybe have lasers able to destroy some blocks, others reflect, and some absorb
- standard moveable blocks, so can change shape of level
- 

- gravity, have gravity switch directions, etc. lots of puzzles there

- switches to trigger things
- two main kinds- toggles, and one way - once on, always on, and some of those can be timed- so on for 5 seconds until press again
- can also have paired switches - so 3 way

- moving platforms, blocks, etc.

- moving enemies

- bouncy/trampolines

- blocks that disolve on touch - nano - also timed
- walls that move/crush - timed and triggered
